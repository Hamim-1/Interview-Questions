        Cons of Using Bootstrap are : 
        1: Bootstrap’s default styles can result in a site that looks generic or too similar to others using the framework.
        2: Bootstrap’s CSS and JavaScript files can be heavy, which may impact performance.
        3: For complex projects with unique design requirements, Bootstrap’s built-in styles might be restrictive. Extensive overrides are sometimes necessary to achieve custom designs, which can lead to bloated CSS and less maintainable code.
        4: The extensive use of CSS styles and JavaScript can cause slower performance on older devices, especially if the project is not optimized by removing unused Bootstrap components.
